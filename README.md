Exclusion of implied warranties.

Uniform Commercial Code 2-316 reads:

> 2-316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties.
>
> (1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty
> and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be
> construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but
> subject to the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic
> evidence (Section 2-202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the
> extent that such construction is unreasonable.
>
> (2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied
> warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must
> mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous,
> and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion
> must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied
> warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that
> "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the
> face hereof."
>
> (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)
>
> (a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied
> warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", "with all faults"
> or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's
> attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is
> no implied warranty; and
>
> (b) when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the
> goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to
> examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects
> which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to
> him; and
>
> (c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of
> dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.
>
> (4) Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with
> the provisions of this Article on liquidation or limitation of damages
> and on contractual modification of remedy (Sections 2-718 and 2-719).

Uniform Commercial Code 1-201(b)(10) reads:

> "Conspicuous", with reference to a term, means so written, displayed,
> or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate
> ought to have noticed it. Whether a term is "conspicuous" or not is a
> decision for the court. Conspicuous terms include the following:
>
> (A) a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the
> surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the
> surrounding text of the same or lesser size; and
>
> (B) language in the body of a record or display in larger type than
> the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the
> surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text
> of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the
> language.
